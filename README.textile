The madvertise JavaScript tag is a very easy way to request ads from the madvertise ad server and display them on your mobile web site.

Please use the following steps to setup madvertise for your mobile web site:
1) Copy the contents of the js-tag.html file into your mobile site exactly in the place where you want the ads to be displayed. 
2) Chose the banner_type you want to receive. Default is MMA. You can find details on the available formats here: https://redmine.madvertise.me/projects/madapi/wiki/Banner_Formats
3) Test your mobile web site. You should newreceive madvertise test banners now.
4) Replace the site token 'TestTokn' with you valid token in order to receive live-ads. (You can get the token by logging in at http://madvertise.com and creating a new site)
5) Optional: You can implement callbacks for 'success', 'error' and 'no_ad_available', which will execute JavaScript code should these events fire.
