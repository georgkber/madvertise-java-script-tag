The madvertise JavaScript Tag is a very easy way to request ads from the madvertise ad server and display them on your mobile web site.

Please use the following steps to setup madvertise for you mobile web site successfully:
1) Copy the content of the js-tag.html file into your mobile site exactly at that place where you want to display the ads. 
2) Chose the banner_type you want to receive. Default is MMA. These are the available formats: https://redmine.madvertise.me/projects/madapi/wiki/Banner_Formats
3) Test your mobile web site. You should receive madvertise test banners now.
4) Replace the site token 'TestTokn' with you valid token in order to receive live-ads. (You can get token by logging in at http://madvertise.com and creating a new site on the platform)
5) optional: You can implement the three callbacks success, error and no_ad_available in order to execute JavaScript code if these events fire.
